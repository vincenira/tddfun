## State the problem.

Make an SVG of a clock. Not a digital clock. Just function that takes a Time from the time package
and spits out an SVG of a clock with all the hands - hour, minute and second pointing in
the right direction

SVGs are fantastic image format to manipulate programmatically because they're written as a series of
shapes, described in XML.
